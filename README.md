Ethereum wasnâ€™t built to handle an insane # of transactions so it gets back up quickly. Polygon is able to handle a higher transaction count and then it bundles up all those transactions up and deposits them to Ethereum as the final source of truth.

Plato is DNS based on Polygon. You can buy your own custom domain and get an NFT to show off your plato domain.
